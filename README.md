## üìä Feature Deep Dive

### 1. Job Scheduling

**Cron Expression Support:**
```python
# Cron format: minute hour day month day_of_week

0 2 * * *      # Daily at 2:00 AM
30 14 * * 1-5  # Weekdays at 2:30 PM
0 */6 * * *    # Every 6 hours
0 0 1 * *      # First day of each month
*/15 * * * *   # Every 15 minutes
```

**Interval-Based Scheduling:**
```python
# Run every N minutes
interval_minutes = 60  # Every hour
interval_minutes = 1440  # Daily (24 hours)
```

### 2. Job Dependencies

Create complex workflows with automatic execution order:

```
Job A (Extract)
    ‚Üì
Job B (Transform) ‚Üê depends on A
    ‚Üì
Job C (Load) ‚Üê depends on B
```

Jobs automatically wait for dependencies to complete successfully before executing.

### 3. Retry Logic

```python
# Automatic retry configuration
max_retries = 3           # Number of retry attempts
retry_delay_seconds = 60  # Delay between retries

# Retry flow:
# 1. Execute job
# 2. If failed and retries remaining:
#    - Wait retry_delay_seconds
#    - Retry execution
# 3. Repeat until success or max_retries exhausted
```

### 4. Execution Strategies

The application uses the **Strategy Pattern** for different job types:

**Python Jobs:**
```python
# Execute Python scripts
command = "python3 script.py arg1 arg2"
# OR
command = "python3 /full/path/to/script.py"
```

**Shell Jobs:**
```python
# Execute shell commands or scripts
command = "./backup.sh"
# OR
command = "tar -czf backup.tar.gz /data"
```

**SQL Jobs:**
```python
# Execute SQL via command-line tools
command = "psql -U user -d database -f query.sql"
# OR
command = "mysql -u user -p password db < query.sql"
```

### 5. Environment Variables

Pass custom environment variables to jobs (JSON format):

```json
{
  "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://localhost/mydb",
  "API_KEY": "secret123",
  "ENV": "production"
}
```

### 6. Notifications

Configure per-job email and Slack notifications:

- **Email**: SMTP configuration in settings
- **Slack**: Webhook URL in settings
- **Triggers**: Success and/or failure
- **Content**: Job name, status, duration, output

## üìñ Database Schema

### Tables

**jobs** (22 fields)
```sql
id, name, description, job_type, command, working_directory,
environment_vars, schedule_type, cron_expression, interval_minutes,
enabled, status, last_run, next_run, max_retries, retry_delay_seconds,
timeout_seconds, notification_email, notify_on_success,
notify_on_failure, created_at, updated_at
```

**job_dependencies**
```sql
id, job_id, depends_on_job_id, created_at
```

**job_executions**
```sql
id, job_id, start_time, end_time, status, exit_code,
output, error_output, retry_count, triggered_by
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Example 1: Daily Data Backup

```python
# Create via GUI or import JSON:
{
  "name": "Daily Database Backup",
  "job_type": "shell",
  "command": "pg_dump mydb > /backups/daily_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql",
  "schedule_type": "cron",
  "cron_expression": "0 2 * * *",
  "enabled": true,
  "max_retries": 2,
  "notification_email": "admin@company.com",
  "notify_on_failure": true
}
```

### Example 2: ETL Pipeline with Dependencies

```python
# Step 1: Extract (runs at 1 AM)
extract_job = {
  "name": "Extract Customer Data",
  "job_type": "python",
  "command": "python3 extract.py",
  "schedule_type": "cron",
  "cron_expression": "0 1 * * *"
}

# Step 2: Transform (depends on extract)
transform_job = {
  "name": "Transform Customer Data",
  "job_type": "python",
  "command": "python3 transform.py",
  "dependencies": ["Extract Customer Data"]
}

# Step 3: Load (depends on transform)
load_job = {
  "name": "Load to Warehouse",
  "job_type": "python",
  "command": "python3 load.py",
  "dependencies": ["Transform Customer Data"]
}
```

### Example 3: Hourly Data Quality Check

```python
quality_check = {
  "name": "Data Quality Validation",
  "job_type": "python",
  "command": "python3 data_quality.py",
  "schedule_type": "interval",
  "interval_minutes": 60,
  "enabled": true,
  "timeout_seconds": 300,
  "max_retries": 1
}
```

  "job_type": "python",
  "command": "python3 generate_report.py",
  "schedule_type": "cron",
  "cron_expression": "0 9 * * 1",  # Monday 9 AM
  "notification_email": "reports@company.com",
  "notify_on_success": true
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers & Notices

### üß™ Proof of Concept Status

This software is provided as a **PROOF OF CONCEPT DEMONSTRATION** and should be treated accordingly:

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NOTICES:**

1. **NOT PRODUCTION-HARDENED**: While functional and well-architected, this software has not undergone extensive production testing, security auditing, or stress testing that enterprise-grade software requires.

2. **NO WARRANTY**: This software is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind. See the MIT License above for full details.
